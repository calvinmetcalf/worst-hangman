The worst possible hangman
===

A version of hangman that tries to pick the worst possible words, inspired by [cheating hangman](https://danq.me/2019/09/26/cheatman/) but slightly different.   Conceptually instead of picking a word and then changing it, it instead goes through a word list and picks the result (letter not there vs letter in a pattern) that gives you the least information.
